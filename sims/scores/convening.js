/* Convening - the pre-pattern. Run before any collaboration pattern.
   Source: https://github.com/jeffrschneider/agentcollab/blob/main/convening.md

   THE STANDARD CAST (the same eight job titles across every simulation)
     PM Program Mgr · TL Tech Lead · CW Copywriter · DS Designer
     AN Analyst · QA QA Engineer · ED Editor · RS Researcher
   A node shows its job title (who it is) and a role chip (what the
   pattern casts it as). Colour says which: violet chair, amber pen,
   mint peer, blue object.                                               */
